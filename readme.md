#### Requirements

1. Create a simple app that displays the information contained in the attached JSON.  

1. If you are displaying more than one user on the screen, just show the first name.  Clicking on the name should show more detailed information about him.  

1. Create appropriate models for the JSON data. You can use a third-party library.

1. The app should work on your average phone and a tablet with roughly the Nexus 9 specs. (Emulated device is fine)

1. It should support landscape and portrait orientation.
